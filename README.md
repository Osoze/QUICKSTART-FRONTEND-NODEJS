### Running locally

Just open the index.html file in a browser. No frameworks needed. :grin:

### Rebuilding the GitHubbers list

The [`js/Hubbers.js`](/js/Hubbers.js) file contains a list with all the public members in the [GitHub](https://github.com/github) organization.
It contains minimal information which is needed and used when the public API request rate limit exceeds.

This file is updated automatically using the [`build.js`](/build.js) script and a [token](https://github.com/settings/tokens):

```sh
$ npm i
$ node build.js <token>
```
